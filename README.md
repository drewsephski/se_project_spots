# Mesto: Photo Sharing Platform

Mesto is a responsive web application designed for sharing photos and interacting with content. It provides users with a clean and intuitive interface to view user profiles, browse a collection of images, and engage with various elements on the page. The application is built with a focus on adaptability, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Key Technologies and Techniques

*   HTML5: Used for structuring the web content, providing a semantic and accessible foundation for the application.
*   CSS3: Employed for comprehensive styling, including layout, typography, colors, and responsive adjustments, with a strong emphasis on modern web design principles.
*   BEM (Block, Element, Modifier): The project's CSS is organized using the BEM methodology, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability of styles. This is reflected in the `blocks/` directory structure (e.g., [`card.css`](blocks/card.css), [`profile.css`](blocks/profile.css)).
*   Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, adapting its layout and elements to provide an optimal viewing experience on a wide range of devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
*   Fonts: Custom fonts are integrated via [`vendor/fonts.css`](vendor/fonts.css) to enhance the visual appeal and typography of the platform.
*   Normalize.css: Included from [`vendor/normalize.css`](vendor/normalize.css) to ensure consistent rendering of HTML elements across different browsers, resetting default styles to a common baseline.
